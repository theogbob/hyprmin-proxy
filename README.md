# HyprMin-proxy
For 2024 Titanium Network Proxathon. Theme: Minimalism.

## HyprMin - Lightweight, Simple, 'just works' proxy
Features (or lack of):
 - No search HTML search bar (URL bar used)
 - Minimal CSS (BLOAT@!!!#!@#@!)
 - Tiny (Very small size when fully minimized)

Proxy is just a simple build of ultraviolet with a simple frontend. At time of making this readme it probably still uses express but I plan to TRY to move it to something faster for a *bit* better performance.
Usage:
`git clone https://github.com/theogbob/hyprmin-proxy`
`cd hyprmin-proxy`
`npm i`
`npm start`
`profit!@#!@#@!`
